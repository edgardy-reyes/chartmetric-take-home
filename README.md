Option 1 - Webpage displaying information from CSV file

1. I chose option 1 because I had prior experience developing webpages in Flask and manipulating CSV's within
   them from my prior internship.

2. I worked approximately 15 hours on this problem.

3. This is a Python Flask webapp that displays the information fed from a given CSV file about various users. To run, make sure the
'templates' folder and the given CSV are in same directory as 'OPT1_Webpage.py', and access IP address from your local machine.

4. Some struggles I faced while completing this assignment where the fact that the CSV file had a lot of nested
values and so I spent quite a bit of time researching things on StackOverflow and other websites trying different
code snippets in order to understand how to manipulate and display the information in the file.
